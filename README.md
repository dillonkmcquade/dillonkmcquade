### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Dillon. I'm a Software Developer.
- Check out my projects -> [dmcquade.dev](https://www.dmcquade.dev)
- My favorite programming language is Go, but I also like Java and Python. I occasionally write some Typescript too.
- I love command-line applications, my favorites are tmux, Lazygit, and Neovim
- Fun fact: I've been using Fedora for the past 4 years and love it
